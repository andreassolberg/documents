Comparison InCommon profile and saml2int
========================================

Metadata
--------

saml2int is very limited on metadata, only refers to metadata interoperability profile.

InCommon includes incommon specific requirements on content of metadata, and how and how often to publish.

InCommon contains this generic parts that could be adopted to saml2int:

  * Info on encryption keys when not TLS/SSL on ACS.
  * Requirements on content:
	* Supported NameIDs
	* Requested attributes
  * Discovery response location

Name identifiers
----------------

Separate section on InCommon.

Text is reasonable. Substance is equivalent to saml2int as far as I can see.

Attributes
----------

Reccommandation on using simple text attribute values is generic and could easily be adopted in saml2int.

MACE-Dir references are edu-specific, may be left out of saml2int. and added in incommon profile.


Attributes and the use of uri format:

  * incommon: MUST use URI format
  * saml2int: SHOULD use URI format




Authentication Request
----------------------

AuthNRequest MUST be sent using HTTP-REDIRECT.

  * Equivalent

Regarding signing of request.

  * Similar, but I prefer the InCommon way of expressing it. Will adopt for saml2int.

Regarding secure endpoints for SSO endpoint:

  * InCommon: SHOULD be protected by SSL
  * saml2int: does not mention.
  * OK to adopt incommon

AuthNRequest MUST include assertioconsumerurl

  * Equivalent
  * saml2int says MUST be checked towards metadata


Protocolbinding set to HTTP-POST or omitted

  * Equivalent

AuthNRequest MUST not contain subject.

  * Equivalent


AuthNRequest + Conditions

  * saml2int: MUST NOT be included
  * incommon: do not specify


AuthNRequest and Conditions element

  * Not mentioned in IncOmmon
  * saml2int: MUST not contain Conditions

Scoping element

  * Similar...
  * InCommon: SHOULD NOT contain scoping
  * saml2int: IdP MUST provide reasonable user experience when element is left out...

NameID Policy should be inclued and allowcreate = true

  * Equivalent

NameID Format in request:

  * Equivalent
 
RequestedAuthnContext:

  * InCommon: may be included, but should only be used when arrangement between sp and idp. Info on comparison.
  * saml2int: should not be used
  * adopt incommon text, which is better.

Response
--------

response MUST be sent using HTTP-POST

  * Equivalent

Securing ACS endpoint, SHOULD be TLS/SSL. Encryption of response.

  * Similar.
  * If the ACS is not secured: InCommon says SHOULD encrypt. saml2int says MUST encrypt.
  * saml2int also specifies that the page containing the `<form>` included the response at the IdP MUST be protected if the content is not encrypted.
  * saml2int has text explaining that having a keydescriptor without use or with use = encryption is a way of telling that it supports decrypting assertions.

Response MUST include Issuer:

  * mentioned in saml2int  only


SP MUST support unsolicited response

  * Equivalent

About the number of asserions, statements etc:

  * Similar

Inclusion of a NameID element in subject in the response

  * incommon: shuold be included
  * saml2int: MUST be included
